# Visualizing Data with Leaflet
### This website provides a new set of tools that will allow us visualize the earthquake data from USGS. We will collect data from their live API endpoints and present following information on global atlas:-

#### Identify each earthquake location with a circle. The color and size of the circle will be determined by the magnitude of the earchquake.
#### Provide popup message for each of these circles. The popup will contain earthquake location, magnitude and date & time of the incident.
#### Create legend to provide context of the mapped data.
#### Integrate the map with tectonic plates data to provide better visualization of seismic activities. 
#### The map will include earthquake location as well as tectonic plates demarkations. However, users will be able to turn on or off these features.
#### We will provide users with three different base maps to choose from with the default map being the "outdoor map".
